    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Rahul S R, a passionate Network Engineer working and continuously learning in the fields of network, network security, and virtualization. 
        Currently, I'm pursuing a BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from IIT Guwahati.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey in network engineering has taught me that understanding how data flows and is protected across networks is more than just a technical skill—it's a crucial part of keeping the digital world safe. 
        I’m also delving into the world of virtualization, which has become an essential component in modern network infrastructure. Combining this with my exploration of AI and data science, I’m excited to find smarter solutions to network security challenges.
